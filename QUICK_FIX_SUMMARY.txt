TRAINING ERROR FIX - QUICK SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROBLEM FIXED:
--------------
The error message "Training error: True" was unhelpful and didn't explain what
went wrong during XGBoost model training.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
1. The file path doesn't exist on this Linux system:
   D:/Zoppler Projects/RadarAnnotation_LRDE/Database/sim_01_straight_low_speed/radar_data_reference.csv
   
2. No validation was performed before attempting to read the file

3. Error messages were not properly displayed

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
---------------------
✓ Enhanced src/ai_engine.py with comprehensive validation:
  - File existence check
  - File permission check  
  - Required columns validation (trackid, Annotation)
  - Empty file detection
  - Better error messages

✓ Improved src/gui.py error handling:
  - Proper error message conversion
  - Better exception handling in WorkerThread

✓ Created validate_training_data.py utility:
  - Pre-validate CSV files before training
  - Clear diagnostic output
  - Specific recommendations

WHAT TO DO NOW:
---------------
1. Get the CSV file onto this Linux system, OR
2. Run the application on the same system where the data is located

Then retry training - you'll now get clear error messages if anything is wrong!

VALIDATION TOOL:
----------------
Before training, validate your CSV file:
  python3 validate_training_data.py /path/to/your/data.csv

DOCUMENTATION:
--------------
- TRAINING_ERROR_SOLUTION.md - Quick guide for users
- TRAINING_ERROR_FIX.md - Detailed technical documentation

All changes tested and validated!
